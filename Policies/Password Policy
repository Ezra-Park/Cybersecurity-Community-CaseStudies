# Password Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for creating, managing, and protecting passwords used to access organizational systems and data. Strong passwords are a fundamental defense against unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, and any other individuals who are granted access to the organization's IT systems and data.

## Password Requirements
All passwords for organizational accounts must meet the following minimum requirements:

1.  **Length:** Minimum of 12 characters.
2.  **Complexity:** Must include a combination of at least three of the following four character types:
    * Uppercase letters (A, B, C...)
    * Lowercase letters (a, b, c...)
    * Numbers (0, 1, 2...)
    * Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &...)
3.  **Uniqueness:** Passwords must not be reused across different organizational accounts, nor should they be identical to personal account passwords (e.g., social media, personal email).
4.  **No Dictionary Words:** Passwords should not be common dictionary words, names, places, or simple patterns (e.g., "password123", "qwerty"). Consider using passphrases (e.g., "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple!").

## Password Management & Protection
1.  **Confidentiality:** Passwords are confidential and must **never** be shared with anyone, including colleagues, supervisors, or IT personnel.
2.  **Storage:**
    * Do not write down passwords on sticky notes, whiteboards, or easily accessible documents.
    * If you must write a password down, store it in a secure, locked location.
    * Consider using an approved password manager for secure storage and generation of complex passwords.
3.  **No Auto-Save in Browsers:** Do not allow web browsers to "remember" or "auto-save" organizational passwords.
4.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Where available and required, users **must** enable and utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an additional layer of security. This typically involves a second verification step (e.g., a code from a mobile app, fingerprint, or physical token).
5.  **Reporting Compromise:** If you suspect your password has been compromised or exposed, change it immediately and report the incident to [Designated Contact, e.g., IT Department].

## Password Changes
* **Mandatory Changes:** Passwords for critical systems may be set to expire periodically, requiring users to change them.
* **Immediate Change:** Passwords must be changed immediately if there is any suspicion of compromise.
