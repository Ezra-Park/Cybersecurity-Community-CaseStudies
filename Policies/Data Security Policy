# Data Security Guidelines

## Purpose
These guidelines outline best practices for handling and protecting the organization's data assets to ensure their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All individuals handling organizational data are responsible for adhering to these guidelines.

## Scope
This policy applies to all data created, processed, stored, or transmitted by or on behalf of the organization, regardless of its format (digital, physical) or storage location. This includes, but is not limited to, customer information, financial records, employee data, intellectual property, and operational data.

## Data Classification (Basic)
For simplicity, data can be broadly categorized to guide handling:
1.  **Confidential/Sensitive:** Data whose unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction could cause significant harm (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial records, trade secrets). Requires the highest level of protection.
2.  **Internal Use Only:** Data not intended for public release but less critical than confidential data (e.g., internal reports, organizational charts).
3.  **Public:** Data intended for public consumption (e.g., marketing materials, public website content). Still requires integrity and availability.

## Data Handling Principles

### 1. Access Control
* **Least Privilege:** Access to data must be granted only to individuals who require it to perform their job duties. Access should be reviewed periodically.
* **Strong Authentication:** Always use strong passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where available, as per the Password Policy, to access data.

### 2. Data Storage
* **Approved Locations:** Store all organizational data only on approved and secured systems (e.g., secure network drives, approved cloud storage services, encrypted devices).
* **Avoid Local Storage:** Do not store sensitive or confidential data on local computer hard drives (C: drive, Desktop, Documents) unless it is a temporary working copy that is later moved to a secured location and deleted locally.
* **Encryption:** Sensitive data should be encrypted both when stored (at rest) and when transmitted (in transit).

### 3. Data Transmission/Sharing
* **Secure Methods:** Use only approved, secure methods for transmitting data (e.g., encrypted email, secure file transfer services, VPNs). Avoid public, unsecured methods (e.g., unencrypted email, public cloud storage).
* **Verification:** Verify the identity of the recipient before sending sensitive data. Be cautious of phishing attempts asking for data.
* **No Unnecessary Sharing:** Do not share sensitive data beyond what is strictly necessary for legitimate business purposes.

### 4. Data Disposal
* **Secure Deletion:** When data is no longer needed, it must be securely deleted or disposed of to prevent unauthorized recovery.
* **Physical Media:** Physical media (e.g., hard drives, USB drives) containing sensitive data must be securely wiped or physically destroyed before disposal or reuse.

### 5. Incident Reporting
* Any suspected or actual data breach, loss, or unauthorized access must be reported immediately to [Designated Contact].
* Prompt reporting is crucial for effective incident response and mitigation.
