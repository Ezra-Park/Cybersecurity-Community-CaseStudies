## I. Introduction to Cybersecurity (5 mins)
* **Why does cybersecurity matter to us?**
    * Protecting data, financial stability, reputation.
    * Threat landscape: common attacks (phishing, malware).
    * Our collective responsibility: cybersecurity is everyone's job.
* **Review of basic concepts:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad).

## II. Phishing Detection & Prevention (10-15 mins)
* **What is Phishing?**
    * Definition: attempts to trick you into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links.
    * Types: Email phishing, spear phishing, smishing (SMS), vishing (voice).
* **Common Red Flags:**
    * Urgent or threatening language.
    * Generic greetings ("Dear User").
    * Spelling/grammar errors.
    * Suspicious sender email addresses (hover, don't click).
    * Unexpected attachments or links (hover, don't click!).
    * Requests for personal/login info.
* **What to Do:**
    * STOP. LOOK. THINK. (Don't rush).
    * Verify sender (call them back using a known number, not one from the email).
    * Report suspicious emails immediately to [Designated Reporting Mechanism, e.g., IT Dept. Security Email].
    * **NEVER** click on suspicious links or open unexpected attachments.

## III. Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (10 mins)
* **Why Passwords are Not Enough:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, breaches.
* **Characteristics of a Strong Password:**
    * Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters).
    * Combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters.
    * Uniqueness (no reuse, especially not for personal accounts).
    * Passphrases vs. short passwords.
* **Password Management Best Practices:**
    * Don't write them down (especially not on sticky notes).
    * Use an approved password manager.
    * Never share passwords.
* **Understanding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * What it is: "something you know, something you have, something you are."
    * How it works (e.g., authenticator apps, SMS codes).
    * Why it's crucial: adds a critical layer of defense.

## IV. Secure Data Handling (7-10 mins)
* **Data Classification Refresher:** (briefly mention Confidential, Internal, Public).
* **Access Control:** Access data only if you need it for your job.
* **Secure Storage:**
    * Store sensitive data only on approved network drives or cloud services.
    * Avoid saving sensitive data to local hard drives or unencrypted USBs.
    * Understand data retention policies.
* **Secure Transmission/Sharing:**
    * Use approved, secure methods (e.g., encrypted email, secure file transfer).
    * Verify recipients before sending sensitive data.
    * Never send sensitive data via unencrypted personal email.
* **Secure Disposal:** How to properly delete data from devices or shared drives when no longer needed.

---

## V. Secure Device Use (5 mins)
* **Screen Locking:** Always lock your computer when stepping away (Windows Key + L / Ctrl+Cmd+Q).
* **Software Updates:** Keep operating systems and applications updated; report issues if you cannot update.
* **Public Wi-Fi:** Be cautious; avoid accessing sensitive information on unsecured public Wi-Fi. Use VPN if possible.
* **Physical Security:** Secure devices when leaving the office; don't leave laptops or phones unattended.

---

## VI. What to Do If Something Goes Wrong (3 mins)
* **Recognize the Signs:** Suspicious emails, unusual system behavior, missing data, unauthorized access attempts.
* **Report Immediately:** Who to contact ([Designated Contact, e.g., IT Department or Supervisor]).
* **Do NOT try to fix it yourself:** You might inadvertently destroy evidence.

---

## VII. Q&A and Resources (Remaining Time)
* Open forum for questions.
* Remind employees of available policies and resources.
